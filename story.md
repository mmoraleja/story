Once upon a time in a software company, there was a lonely programmer. He is trying to look for 
a party of friends. But he got tired of waiting for the party so he decided to study GIT. While 
he was waiting he met some friends who are also studying GIT.  After studying they all drink 
and found other groups to join them.
