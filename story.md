The Tale of the Happy Programmer

Once upon a time in a software company, there was a lonely programmer. Michael is trying to look for a party of friends. But he got tired of waiting for the party so he decided to study GIT. While 
he was waiting he met some friends who are also studying GIT.  After studying they all drink 
and found other groups to join them.

Now there's more than 1 programmer and he is no longer lonely.

And he program happily ever after.
